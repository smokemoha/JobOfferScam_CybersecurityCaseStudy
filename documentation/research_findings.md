## Airspan Company Verification

*   **Official Website:** The official website for Airspan Networks is `airspan.com`. The website appears professional and provides detailed information about their products, services, and company background. The contact information on the website lists the same headquarters address as the one in the offer letter: 5201 Congress Ave, Suite 130, Boca Raton, FL 33487, USA.
*   **Job Postings:** I navigated to the "Careers" section of the official Airspan website. There are several job openings listed, primarily for engineering and technical roles in various locations (India, USA, etc.). However, there is **no listing for a "Data Entry Clerk" position**. This is a major discrepancy.

## Common Job Scam Tactics

My research on common job scams, particularly for remote data entry positions, revealed several red flags that align with the situation:

*   **Unrealistically High Pay:** The offered pay of $25/hour for a data entry position is significantly higher than the industry average, especially for a remote role. This is a common lure used by scammers.
*   **Generic Job Descriptions:** The job description provided in the interview chat is vague and lacks specific details about the software or systems to be used.
*   **Unprofessional Communication:** The use of a Gmail address (`infoairspan@gmail.com`) for official communication is highly unprofessional and a major red flag. Legitimate companies almost always use their own domain for email.
*   **Request for Personal Information:** While not explicitly stated yet, these scams often lead to requests for personal and financial information under the guise of setting up payroll or sending equipment.

## Email Sender Investigation

Searching for the email address `infoairspan@gmail.com` did not yield any official results linking it to Airspan Networks. The search results were primarily related to Gmail security and common scam tactics. This further reinforces the suspicion that the email is not from a legitimate Airspan representative.

## Conclusion of Research

Based on the research, it is highly likely that this job offer is a scam. The combination of an unlisted job position on the official company website, the use of a generic Gmail address, an unusually high salary for the role, and the quick and informal hiring process are all strong indicators of a fraudulent scheme.
